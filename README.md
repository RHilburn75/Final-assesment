# Final-assesment

First,  I want to thank Nick and Xavier for helping me through this bootcamp.  What a great experience this has been.  I have learned a lot in these last 6 months, that will go with me for a lifetime.

I also would like to thank my team on the final project.  The experience in the last month to work in a team enviroment is something that I needed to work on.  We pulled together as a team and divided and conquered effectively.  Our project was on beer andwhat  stles of beer would be needed in order to start a brewery. Using Pandas, Juypter Notebook, Machine learning and Tableau, just to name a few, were processes we used to in order to deliver our results.  Despite that, it was the bonding and friendships that I created that I will be my biggest takeaway.

For me personally,  I would like carry this forward and use this experience and expand in my career or pivot on a new one.  

Thank you for everything.
